A mod for Vintage Story adding world generation additions and new entities

This is a fork of 91loocekaj's, aka jakecool19 on the Vintage Story forums, mod Lands of Chaos. It is unchanged except for some checks to stop use of the POIRegistry on client-side (it shouldn't be), preventing a crash.

To reiterate: I DID NOT CHANGE THIS MOD IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. I only added 3 lines of code and fixed 1 bug.

jakecool19, if you're reading this and want this taken down, just send me a message either here or on the vintage story forums (stinky_lizard_).

This will not be kept up to date with future releases of Lands of Chaos.
